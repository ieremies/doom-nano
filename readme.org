#+Title: DOOM nano

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This repo is for porting the excelent work of Nicolas Rougier to doom emacs.

Current state:
[[./screenshot.png]]

*Disclaimer:* this is /literally/ my first elisp project. I advise some caution while navegating through my parentheses.

* Install
Add the following to =packages.el.=
#+begin_src elisp
(package! doom-nano
  :recipe (:host github :repo "ieremies/doom-nano"))
#+end_src

Copy =doom-nano-light-theme.el= and/or =doom-nano-dark-theme.el= to your ~.doom.d/themes/~ and add the following to your =config.el=.
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'doom-nano-ui)
(setq doom-theme 'doom-nano-light) ;; or dark
#+end_src

** The other way
One other option is to (some what) directly use Rougier's work:
#+begin_src elisp
;; This goes in packages.el
(package! nano
  :recipe (:host github :repo "rougier/nano-emacs"))
(package! doom-nano
  :recipe (:host github :repo "ieremies/doom-nano"))
#+end_src
and
#+begin_src elisp
;; This goes in config.el
(require 'doom-nano-ui)         ;; only ui changes

(setq doom-theme 'doom-plain)   ;; see above
(require 'nano-theme-light)     ;; set color scheme

;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-nord)
;; (require 'nano-theme-dark)

(require 'doom-nano-faces)      ;; apply faces
#+end_src

The problem with the latter form is some faces may not behave well (like the modeline). To prevent that, you can set a doom-theme that matches. I got the best results using =doom-plain= for the light theme and =doom-nord= for the dark one.

* TO-DO's
- The modeline
- Ideally I want to change the themes to use inheritance, but I could not manage to get the faces defined...
- Some categories of faces defined in [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs/blob/master/nano-theme.el][nano-emacs/nano-theme.el]] are not yet ported
- nano-theme-dark

* Future plans
The end goal of this project is to be the promissed ~doom :ui nano~ package.
To do so, it has to define a "nano-like" theme for all ~doom-themes~.
The best way that I see this happening is deducing the ~nano-colors~ from the default faces defined in every ~doom-theme~ and redefining all faces based on that.
