*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This repo is for porting the excelent work of Nicolas Rougier to doom emacs.

Current state:

*Disclaimer:* this is /literally/ my first elisp project. I advise some caution while navegating through my parentheses.

* Install
Clone this repo, copy =doom-nano-light-theme.el= and/or =doom-nano-dark-theme.el= and add the following to your config:
#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/proj/doom-nano/")    ;; path to where you cloned this repo
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/bin/nano-emacs/")    ;; path to where you cloned nano-emacs
(require 'doom-nano-ui)                         ;; apply ui changes
(setq doom-theme 'doom-nano-light)              ;; set theme
(require 'doom-nano-faces)                      ;; apply some more faces (to be removed in the future)
#+end_src

* TO-DO's
A lot, most of it is marked on the code.

* Future plans
The end goal of this project is to be the promissed ~doom :ui nano~ package.
To do so, it has to define a "nano-like" theme for all ~doom-themes~.
The best way that I see this happening is deducing the ~nano-colors~ from the default faces defined in every ~doom-theme~ and redefining all faces based on that.
